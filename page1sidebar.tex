\begin{quote}
%Professional summaries are critical to your job application. They tell your story in a nutshell, giving employers a sneak peek of what your talents are and how you can benefit their organization.
% For Data Engineer resumes, these professional summaries need to be specific and quantitative.

% Example "Senior Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience in building data intensive applications, tackling challenging architectural and scalability problems in Finance. Currently helping Axia with Petabyte scale data pipelines."

% The above resume summary is good for a number of reasons.

%First, when hiring managers look for Data Engineers they see that very few people actually have more than 5 years of experience in Data. So, when you list that upfront, it helps them.

%Second, the resume summary talks about your true passion (architectures, scale and data intensive apps).

%Third, it gives the hiring manager an exact understanding of what you are currently working on.

% Focus your research objective or summary on WHAT YOU CAN OFFER your prospective employer, not what you want to get out of the job.
